          <p class= "p1"> Economic development and cultural diversity are the key factors that increasingly lure visitors from abroad.Since around a decade, Taiwan has been providing many incentives to students from abroad (apparently that’s why I found myself here). As a result of this government initiative, Taiwanese could observe a speedy increase in the number of foreigners who usually get lured here by exchange programs and scholarships for learning Mandarin language. Here are some stats to let you imagine the scale of growth: in 2016, total number of enrolled international students reached 116.4K, marking 380% growth compared to year 2007!
           </p>

           <p class= "p1"> But let’s not focus on students here, as entrepreneurship is receiving much more attention these days. In fact, Taiwan is trying more than ever to attract new business opportunities from abroad. Having put a lot of focus on nurturing entrepreneurs in recent years, Taiwanese frequently highlight advantages of setting up a business here, despite of relatively small market size. You might not know that Taiwan is ranked the best place to start a business in Asia, ranking No. 6 out of 130 countries in the world, based on the 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Index (GEI). If you wonder what’s the secret of this success, the answer might be a huge startup craze that you can observe here. I believe it’s mostly seeded by popularity of “Silicon Valley dream”, and is supported by startup hubs, aiming to harvest innovative thinking and help people translate it into business language. So if you think seriously about joining or creating a startup in Taiwan, Google will lead you to a number of incubators, accelerators, and social centers for entrepreneurs.</p>

           <p class= "p1"> Besides, administration of President Tsai Ying-wen (first female president, elected in 2016) has also brought some new policies to increase Taiwan’s international competitiveness in the long term. Asia Silicon Valley Development Plan is one of the initiatives to upgrade Taiwan’s startup and entrepreneurship ecosystem. It aims mainly to promote innovation and R&D for devices and applications of the IOT. Another example can be so called Dragons’ Chamber Taiwan” – launched in 2016, the first official event for non-citizen founders of startups in Taiwan. Main idea behind was to provide a bridge between angel investors and foreign entrepreneurs.</p>
