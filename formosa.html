          <p class= "p1"> For those who still don’t have a clue why Taiwan is a remarkable place, let me use one word that will put it right: “Formosa”. It means a beautiful island, and it used to be a name of Taiwan, given by Portuguese colonists centuries ago, as they represen­ted first Europeans to reach the island in 1544. Indeed, broad diversity of Taiwanese landscape, makes it uniquely beautiful: you must see Taroko Park with challenging hiking trails over river canyon, east coast beaches with mesmerizing cliffs, Green Island with one of the richest coral reefs in Asia, Sun moon lake with awesome biking routes around it… I could go on and on.
           </p>

           <p class= "p1"> But aside from great nature spots, Taiwan offers something that very few places in the world can offer – overwhelming feeling of kindness and safety. Why? People are very peaceful here and they tend to be very obedient to laws and policies. Also, extensive coverage of surveillance cameras throughout Taiwan helps with deterring the majority of criminal activity, as the overall crime rate is only 1.3%, and overall rate of violent crime against foreigners is just 0.01 % (what!?).</p>

           <p class= "p1"> Taiwanese are progressive-thinking in many ways, and despite of its uncertain political environment, Taiwan is a very convenient place to live for everyone. Me and many of my foreign friends have found Taiwan as our second home. The amount of friendliness, empathy and helpful attitude of locals never stop surprising me, sometimes it really makes me feel like I live in some surreal world, away from problems of the real world.</p>
