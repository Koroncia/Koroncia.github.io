          <p class= "p1"> There’s been an impressive number of research on how diversity brings more options, solutions and creativity into any kind of environment. I’ve had a chance to prove this theory while living here – a country of embroiled political condition, yet, with a very vibrant international landscape. In fact, the point of me writing here is to briefly show you how open-minded and forward thinking Taiwanese are, and how they embrace diversity to shape a modern & progressive image of their country. Religious diversity in Taiwan is usually a big surprise to visitors. In a climate of religious intolerance and ideological conflicts worldwide, Taiwan thrives at spiritual fusion in harmonious and… affirmative way. In other words, people choose what they like to believe and they practice it how they like, without any formal constraints. There’s no “right” and “wrong” in the aspect of religion. You can find here an integration of hybrid spiritual practices, as Taiwanese like to incorporate beliefs from Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism, Confucianism and animism from Taiwan’s aboriginal communities.

           <p class= "p1"> Sexual preferences are still a taboo in most of the Asian countries, where communities are often very conservative and constrained by government control. As a contrast to that, Taiwanese government is actively supporting LGBT rights, and in May 2017 Taiwan government was the first in Asia to announce constitutional protection of same-sex marriage. It’s pretty stunning that no other Asian country has ever committed to protect same-sex couples and provide them with same rights as heterosexual couples.</p>

           <p class= "p1"> What about gender gap? With the progress of social changes, awareness of women’s rights in Taiwan has been recognized over the recent years. It resulted in electing the first female president in 2016, as well as it increased female participation ratio in parliament up to 37.2%. It is more than you can see in any other Asian country, and it’s the 8th highest female participation ratio in the world. Wage equality statistics also look quite optimistic, as Taiwan keeps narrowing the gap, and in 2016 it stood at 14 percent, down 0.5 percent from the year before. For a comparison, in the US the wage gap stands for 17%, and in France 15.5%. From the DGBAS index perspective, Taiwan ranked 38th in the world in terms of gender equality , higher than neighboring Singapore, China, Japan. </p>
